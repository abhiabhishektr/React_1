## DOM Concepts in JavaScript

DOM is like a tree representing a webpage. JavaScript can change it to make web pages interactive.

## Difference Between Actual DOM and Virtual DOM

Actual DOM is what you see on the webpage, and changing it can be slow. Virtual DOM is a faster copy that React uses to update only what's changed.

## Difference Between Single Page and Multi-Page Application

Single Page Apps load once and update parts, giving smoother experiences. Multi-Page Apps load new pages for each interaction.

## CSR vs SSR

CSR renders pages in the browser, SSR does it on the server before sending to the browser.

## Concept of Reusability

Reusability means using components multiple times in an app, making it easier to manage and maintain.

## ES6 Versions Syntaxes

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They are especially useful for short, one-line functions.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### Map

The `map()` method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. It's handy for transforming arrays without mutating the original one.

```javascript
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
```

### Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables. It provides a concise way to extract multiple properties at once.

```javascript
const { name, age } = person;
```

### Filter

The `filter()` method creates a new array with elements that pass a test specified by a function. It's useful for selecting specific elements from an array.

```javascript
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
```

### Reduce

The `reduce()` method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It's often used for summing up values or transforming arrays into other data structures.

```javascript
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
```

### Import/Export

`import` and `export` are used to work with modules in JavaScript, allowing you to split code into separate files.

```javascript
// module.js
export const name = 'John';
export const age = 30;

// app.js
import { name, age } from './module.js';
```

## Concept of Hooks

Hooks are functions that allow you to use React features in functional components. They enable you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

### useState

`useState` is a hook that allows functional components to manage state.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### useEffect

`useEffect` is a hook that performs side effects in functional components.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    // Effect code here
}, [dependencies]);
```

### useRef

`useRef` is a hook that returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument.

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
```

### useHistory vs useNavigate

`useHistory` is a hook provided by React Router for managing browser history.

```jsx
const history = useHistory();
```

`useNavigate` is a hook introduced in React Router v6 for programmatically navigating in a route-based application.

```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate();
```

---

## Concept of Event Handlers

Event handlers are functions that are invoked in response to specific events, such as clicks or changes. They are used to add interactivity to web applications.

### onClick

`onClick` is an event handler used to trigger a function when an element is clicked.

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

### onChange

`onChange` is an event handler used to trigger a function when the value of an input element changes.

```jsx
<input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
```

## Concept of React Router

React Router is a library for adding navigation and routing to React applications. It allows you to define routes, switch between views, and pass parameters.

```jsx
<BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        <Redirect to="/" />
    </Switch>
</BrowserRouter>
```

```
